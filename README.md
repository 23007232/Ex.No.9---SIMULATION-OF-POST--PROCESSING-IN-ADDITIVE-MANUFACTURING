## OUTPUT :

## Support Removal Process:
## step 1:

## This is the main part attached with the support structure which needs to be removed.

## step 2:
## ![image](https://github.com/23007232/Ex.No.9---SIMULATION-OF-POST--PROCESSING-IN-ADDITIVE-MANUFACTURING/assets/139115574/53bc4a1f-a115-4d59-b179-b907734d3725)
## Chemical solution for removal of support material is taken in a container.

## step 3:
## ![image](https://github.com/23007232/Ex.No.9---SIMULATION-OF-POST--PROCESSING-IN-ADDITIVE-MANUFACTURING/assets/139115574/84225c99-8cc6-4d10-9b01-bdf6f739f29c)
## The part with support is dipped and allowed to set inside the container.

## step 4:
## ![image](https://github.com/23007232/Ex.No.9---SIMULATION-OF-POST--PROCESSING-IN-ADDITIVE-MANUFACTURING/assets/139115574/2c063661-fd07-426d-b606-30b5e02ef3f0)
## After this process we will get out final product without the support structure.

## step 5&6:
## ![image](https://github.com/23007232/Ex.No.9---SIMULATION-OF-POST--PROCESSING-IN-ADDITIVE-MANUFACTURING/assets/139115574/510f5bc2-1c06-49f1-b660-97f196ad84ef)
## This is the start and stop of the process for support removal which is nothing but allowing the product the set inside the container.

## UV Curing of 3D printed part
## step 1:
## ![image](https://github.com/23007232/Ex.No.9---SIMULATION-OF-POST--PROCESSING-IN-ADDITIVE-MANUFACTURING/assets/139115574/c41caf57-e00e-4374-92f6-129b7126aa7f)
## This is our part before UV curing.

## step 2:
## ![image](https://github.com/23007232/Ex.No.9---SIMULATION-OF-POST--PROCESSING-IN-ADDITIVE-MANUFACTURING/assets/139115574/d1e714ae-b9d9-431d-a867-accd2732aeb3)
## These are the UV curing machines that heat the model to bring it to its ideal mechanical properties after being printed.

## step 3:
## ![image](https://github.com/23007232/Ex.No.9---SIMULATION-OF-POST--PROCESSING-IN-ADDITIVE-MANUFACTURING/assets/139115574/b15321e0-2538-49df-8932-5077f2958909)
## Our patr is placed inside the Heat Treatement Oven for Heat Treatement process.

## step 4:

## This is our part after the process of UV 
## step 5&6:

## Curing differs from the other post-processing options as it enhanches also the physical quality of the model with properties.

## Heat Treatment of 3D printed part:
## step 1:

## ![image](https://github.com/23007232/Ex.No.9---SIMULATION-OF-POST--PROCESSING-IN-ADDITIVE-MANUFACTURING/assets/139115574/49639c6c-89e8-4979-9fb2-a576cb3a59c0)
## This is our part before Heat Treatement Process.

## step 2:

## ![image](https://github.com/23007232/Ex.No.9---SIMULATION-OF-POST--PROCESSING-IN-ADDITIVE-MANUFACTURING/assets/139115574/0bbbdbc9-a17d-44f5-a7fe-6706eab8e474)
## This is the Heat treatement oven. In which we will place our part.

## step 3:

## ![image](https://github.com/23007232/Ex.No.9---SIMULATION-OF-POST--PROCESSING-IN-ADDITIVE-MANUFACTURING/assets/139115574/d7e01e12-1a77-4fad-983f-b437d2080f85)
## Our patr is placed inside the Heat Treatement Oven for Heat Treatement process.

## step 4:

## ![image](https://github.com/23007232/Ex.No.9---SIMULATION-OF-POST--PROCESSING-IN-ADDITIVE-MANUFACTURING/assets/139115574/b83a466b-2f60-4cd2-8f53-d0e0e42e5125)
## This is our product after the Heat treatment process.Heat Treatment removes the internal stresses developed in part during printing and changes the part's microstructure.

## step 5&6:

## ![image](https://github.com/23007232/Ex.No.9---SIMULATION-OF-POST--PROCESSING-IN-ADDITIVE-MANUFACTURING/assets/139115574/f4cbc498-e7b0-44ce-b2bf-27b41a0e6a3c)
## Normally in modern use,the microstructure's change targets explicit properties like hardness,strength,sturdiness,and wear opposition.
